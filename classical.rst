Adopting alternative foundations of mathematics

What is the point of constructive mathematics?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. epigraph::

    Constructive mathematics is in its infancy.  According to some, it
    is doomed to the role of scavenger.  These people conceive of
    classical mathematics as establishing the grand design and the
    imaginative insight, leaving the constructivists to add whatever
    embellishments their credos demand.  Although totally wrong, this
    viewpoint hints at a truth: The most urgent task of the
    constructivist is to give predictive embodiment to the ideas and
    techniques of classical mathematics.  Classical mathematics is not
    totally divorced from reality.  On the contrayr, most of it has a
    strongly constructive cast.  Much of the constructivization of
    classical mathematics is therefore routine; constructive versions
    of many standard results are readily at hand.  This makes it easy
    to miss the point, which is *not* to find a constructive version
    of this or that, or even of every, classical result.  The point is
    not even to find elegant substitutes for whole classical theories.
    The point rather is to use classical mathematics, at least
    initially, as a guide.  Much will be of little value to the
    constructivist, much will be constructive per se, and much will
    raise fundamental questions which classically are trivial or
    perhaps do not even make sense. The emphasis will be on the
    discovery of useful and incisive numerical information.  It is the
    incisiveness and scope of the information, not the elegencae of
    the format, that is relevant.
