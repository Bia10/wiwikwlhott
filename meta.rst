Meta-theory
===========

Topology
--------

HoTT is *not* a internal language for topology. TODO: say something
about modalities that is correct.

Homotopy
--------

Within the HoTT community, "homotopy theory" refers to abstract homotopy
theory in the sense of, for example, Quillen model categories, or more
generally homotopy categories. The category of topological spaces and
continuous maps is one such model category. However, it is not clear if
HoTT is an internal language for *all* model categories. In particular,
the "homotopy" of HoTT does not (necessarily) refer to the homotopies of
point-set topology.

Paths and continuity
--------------------

-  continuity of functions on the reals or other metric spaces
