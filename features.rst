Type-theoretical features
=========================

{induction,recursion}-{induction,recursion}
-------------------------------------------

- they are different, and neither is a generalisation of the other:
  see forsberg's papers

W-types
--------

- aka GADTs (?): every instance of a datatype declaration is really
  just a W-type. compare with unimath (which doesn't assume to have
  them)

Initial algebras
----------------

Coinduction
-----------

- pi-types
- altenkirch's presentation?
