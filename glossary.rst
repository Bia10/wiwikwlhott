   proposition
   hproposition
      A type with the property that all its elements are equal.

   pointed type
      A pointed type is a type :math:`X` together with a point of
      :math:`X`.  In other words, a pointed type is an element of
      :math:`\sum_{X:\mathcal{U}}X`.

   weak principle of excluded middle
      This axiom is a weakening of the principle of excluded middle.
      Whereas the principle of excluded middle says that, given a type
      :math:`P`, we can decide the truth of :math:`P`, that is, we get
      :math:`P+\neg P`, the weak principle of excluded middle only
      says we can decide the truth of :math:`\neg P`, that is, it
      tells us :math:`\neg P + \neg \neg P`.
